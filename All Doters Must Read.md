So, I can tell that python is terrible language for this idea, so I will write it on C++.

Since I won't gonna appear on pairs today, I will just send here the whole code and file I complied on the VisualStudio

You just need to show the code in the "C++ ver" and open the exe file I complied with the name "Randomizer.exe"

If you have any questions just write to me in telegram, thats all
